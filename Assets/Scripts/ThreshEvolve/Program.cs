 		* being evolved. The program demos how the GA works by setting up a
 		* ThreshPop and simulating a generation (round of the game) using that
 		* population. The Gen2Phen method maps an int to whatever data type and
 		* range the threshold needs to be for its use in the game.  Actually, only
 		* the chromLeng lowest order bits in the int are manipulated by the GA
 		* machinery.  This means that the chromosome length is very likely way
 		* less than 32 bits and must be stricly <= 32 to fit in an unsigned int.
 		* The Fitness method simulates the fitness for an individual,
 		* which would be determined by the end of a round of the game (earlier for
 		* villagers that either make it on the cart or get eaten). This class only
 		* interacts directly with the ThreshPop class.
 		* 
 		* As a note, passing around a uint as the genotype instead of encapsulating
 		* it in an object is a bit lazy because it hard-wires a maximum 32-bit
 		* chromosome, but it simplifies the code because you can do arithmetic
 		* with it directly, and working with a chromosome some arbitrary length
 		* up to 32 bits gives plenty of space for high-resolution parameters.
 		* Actually, 8 or 10 bits might be plenty for most thresholds.
 		* Remember that the number of bits determines the size of the search space,
 		* so fewer bits will result in faster evolution, at the expense of precision
 		* in the parameter being evolved.
 		* Life is all about tradeoffs, even artificial life...
